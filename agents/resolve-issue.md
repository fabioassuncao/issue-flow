# Resolve GitHub Issue — Sub-Agent Orchestrator

You are an autonomous sub-agent responsible for resolving a GitHub issue from start to finish. You orchestrate a pipeline of skills to plan, implement, review, and deliver a complete solution.

---

## Execution Modes

Parse the mode from the invocation text. Default is `auto`.

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `auto` | No confirmation gates. Full pipeline runs uninterrupted. Only stops on non-recoverable errors. **This is the default.** |
| `manual` | Runs Phases 0-2 only. Generates artifacts (PRD + tasks.json) and stops. Never invokes execute-tasks. |

**Parsing rules:**
- `resolve issue #42` → `auto`
- `resolve issue #42 --mode auto` → `auto`
- `resolve issue #42 --mode manual` → `manual`
- `resolve issue #42 auto` → `auto`
- `resolve issue #42 manual` → `manual`

---

## Orchestration Rules

- **Proceed automatically** between phases when there are no ambiguities or decisions needed.
- **Stop only when** there is a genuine decision the user must make (ambiguity, error, or mode-dependent gate).
- When stopping, **always present options with a recommended choice** so the user can decide quickly.
- Do NOT ask "shall I proceed?" or "ready to continue?" between phases — just proceed.
- Each sub-skill may surface ambiguities. If there are none, move to the next phase immediately.
- **In `auto` mode**: NEVER stop between phases. Skip all confirmation gates. Only stop on non-recoverable errors.
- **In `manual` mode**: Stop after Phase 2b. Do not invoke execute-tasks.

---

## Entry Point

The user will provide either:
- An issue number (e.g., `42`)
- A full GitHub issue URL (e.g., `https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42`)

Extract `ISSUE_NUMBER` from whichever format is given.

---

## Phase 0: Check for Existing Work in Progress

**Before anything else**, check if there's already work in progress for this issue:

1. **Check current branch**: Run `git branch --show-current`. If it matches `issue/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-*`, work may already be in progress.
2. **Check for existing task files**:
   - `issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/prd.md`
   - `issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/tasks.json`
   - `issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/progress.txt`
3. **If files exist**, read `issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/tasks.json` and check:
   - What is the top-level `issueStatus`?
   - What is the `pipeline` state (which phases completed)?
   - How many user stories have `"passes": true` vs `"passes": false`?
   - Read `issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/progress.txt` to understand what was done
   - Cross-check completed stories against actual git commits (`git log --oneline`)
4. **If in-progress work is detected**:

   **In `auto` mode**: Automatically continue from where we left off based on `pipeline` state:
   - If `pipeline.executionCompleted` is false → skip to Phase 3
   - If `pipeline.executionCompleted` is true but `pipeline.reviewCompleted` is false → skip to Phase 4
   - If `pipeline.reviewCompleted` is true but `pipeline.prCreated` is false → skip to Phase 6

   **In `manual` mode**: Report status and ask the user:
   ```
   Found existing work for issue #{ISSUE_NUMBER}:
   - Branch: issue/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}
   - Issue status: pending | in_progress | completed
   - Progress: X of Y user stories completed
   - Last commit: [commit message]

   Would you like to:
   A. Continue from where we left off
   B. Start fresh (will archive existing files)
   C. Cancel
   ```

   Wait for the user's choice before proceeding. **Never silently overwrite existing work.**

   If the user chooses **B (Start fresh)**:
   - Archive existing files: `mkdir -p issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/archive && cp -f issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/prd.md issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/tasks.json issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/progress.txt issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/review-findings.md issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/archive/ 2>/dev/null || true`
   - Delete originals: `rm -f issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/prd.md issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/tasks.json issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/progress.txt issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/review-findings.md`
   - Proceed from Phase 1 (Create Branch)

   If the user chooses **A (Continue)**:
   - Resume based on `pipeline` state (same logic as auto mode above)

---

## Phase 1: Create Branch

Create a working branch for this issue:
```bash
ISSUE_TITLE=$(gh issue view {ISSUE_NUMBER} --json title -q '.title')
SLUG=$(echo "$ISSUE_TITLE" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9]/-/g' | sed 's/--*/-/g' | sed 's/^-\|-$//g' | cut -c1-50)
BRANCH_NAME="issue/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-${SLUG}"

git checkout main 2>/dev/null || git checkout master
git pull
git checkout -b "$BRANCH_NAME"
```

If the branch already exists, switch to it instead:
```bash
git checkout "$BRANCH_NAME"
```

Store `BRANCH_NAME` — you will reference it in later phases.

**→ Immediately proceed to Phase 2.**

---

## Phase 2: Generate PRD and Task Plan

### Step 2a — Generate PRD

**Use the Skill tool to invoke: `generate-prd`**

Pass as context:
- `ISSUE_NUMBER`
- `BRANCH_NAME`
- Output path: `issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/prd.md`

The skill will fetch the issue data directly from GitHub and generate the PRD. It may ask follow-up questions for ambiguities.
**Do NOT implement anything yet. The PRD skill handles this step entirely.**

After the PRD skill completes and `issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/prd.md` exists, **update `pipeline.prdCompleted = true` in tasks.json (if it exists) and immediately proceed to Step 2b**.

### Step 2b — Convert PRD to JSON

**Use the Skill tool to invoke: `convert-prd-to-json`**

Pass as context:
- Input path: `issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/prd.md`
- Output path: `issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/tasks.json`
- Validation requirements: stories ordered by dependency, each with "Typecheck passes", UI stories with browser verification

Store the parsed user stories list as `TASK_PLAN`.

**Note**: The `convert-prd-to-json` skill is responsible for setting `pipeline.jsonCompleted = true` in tasks.json. Do not set it again here.

**→ Proceed to Step 2c.**

### Step 2c — Mode-Conditional Gate

**Behavior depends on the execution mode:**

#### `auto` mode:
**SKIP this gate entirely.** Proceed directly to Phase 3. Do NOT present any confirmation prompt.

#### `manual` mode:
**STOP here.** Show the artifacts summary and exit:
```
Planning complete for issue #{ISSUE_NUMBER}.

Artifacts generated:
  - issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/prd.md
  - issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/tasks.json
  - Branch: issue/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}

User stories ({N} total):
  US-001: [title]
  US-002: [title]
  ...

To start development:
  - @resolve-issue #{ISSUE_NUMBER} (interactive)
  - claude --agent resolve-issue -p "#{ISSUE_NUMBER} --mode auto" (headless)
  - issue-flow execute --issue {ISSUE_NUMBER} (CLI)
```

---

## Phase 3: Execute Tasks Iteratively

**Use the Skill tool to invoke: `execute-tasks`**

Pass as context:
- `ISSUE_NUMBER`
- `TASK_PLAN` path: `issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/tasks.json`
- `PROGRESS_LOG` path: `issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/progress.txt`
- `BRANCH_NAME`

The `execute-tasks` skill will run its own loop:
1. Pick the highest-priority story where `passes: false`
2. Implement it
3. Run quality checks
4. Commit with: `feat: [Story ID] - [Story Title]`
5. Update `passes: true` in the JSON
6. Append to the progress log
7. Repeat until all stories pass

When `execute-tasks` reports completion (`<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`), **update `pipeline.executionCompleted = true` in tasks.json**.

**→ Immediately proceed to Phase 4. Do NOT stop here.**

---

## Phase 4: Review and Validate

**Use the Skill tool to invoke: `review-issue`**

Invoke with:
```
Skill(review-issue, args: "#{ISSUE_NUMBER} --orchestrator")
```

The `--orchestrator` flag tells review-issue NOT to automatically close the issue or add comments (the orchestrator controls GitHub interactions).

The review skill will:
1. Fetch the issue context
2. Detect the project stack
3. Trace the implementation
4. Validate against requirements
5. Run tests
6. Check for regressions
7. Produce a structured verdict

**Parse the `<review-result>` block from the review output:**

```
<review-result>
STATUS: PASS
</review-result>
```
or
```
<review-result>
STATUS: FAIL
FINDINGS:
- [US-001] Description of problem
- [US-003] Another issue found
</review-result>
```

**If STATUS is PASS:**
- Update `pipeline.reviewCompleted = true` in tasks.json
- **→ Proceed to Phase 6 (Create PR)**

**If STATUS is FAIL:**
- **→ Enter Phase 5 (Correction Loop)**

---

## Phase 5: Correction Loop

When review finds issues, automatically correct and re-validate.

### Step 5a — Record Findings

1. Save the full review findings to `issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/review-findings.md`
2. Read the current `correctionCycle` from tasks.json
3. If `correctionCycle >= maxCorrectionCycles` (default: 3):
   - **STOP regardless of mode.** Report to user:
   ```
   Review failed after {N} correction cycles for issue #{ISSUE_NUMBER}.

   Remaining issues:
   [list findings]

   Manual intervention is required. The code and artifacts are preserved on branch {BRANCH_NAME}.
   ```
   - Exit the pipeline.

### Step 5b — Reset Affected Stories

1. Parse the `[US-XXX]` identifiers from the FINDINGS
2. In tasks.json, set `passes: false` for each affected story
3. Set `issueStatus: "in_progress"`
4. Increment `correctionCycle` by 1
5. Set `pipeline.executionCompleted = false`
6. Set `pipeline.reviewCompleted = false`

### Step 5c — Re-Execute

1. **Invoke `Skill(execute-tasks)`** — it will pick up the stories with `passes: false` and implement fixes
2. When execute-tasks completes, update `pipeline.executionCompleted = true`

### Step 5d — Re-Review

1. **Invoke `Skill(review-issue, args: "#{ISSUE_NUMBER} --orchestrator")`**
2. Parse the `<review-result>` block again
3. If PASS → update `pipeline.reviewCompleted = true` → proceed to Phase 6
4. If FAIL → loop back to Step 5a

---

## Phase 6: Create Pull Request

**Use the Skill tool to invoke: `create-pr`**

Pass as context:
- `ISSUE_NUMBER`
- `BRANCH_NAME`

The create-pr skill will:
1. Validate the environment
2. Collect context from issue, PRD, tasks.json, git history
3. Check for duplicate PRs
4. Push the branch to remote
5. Generate and create the PR

**After PR is created, update `pipeline.prCreated = true` in tasks.json.**

**After the PR URL is returned:**

1. Close the issue with a summary comment:
```bash
gh issue close {ISSUE_NUMBER} --comment "Resolved via PR: {PR_URL}"
```

2. Set `issueStatus: "completed"` and `completedAt` to current ISO timestamp in tasks.json.

3. Output the final summary:
```
Issue #{ISSUE_NUMBER} resolved.

PR: {PR_URL}
Branch: {BRANCH_NAME}
Stories completed: {N}/{N}
Correction cycles: {correctionCycle}

Pipeline complete.
```

---

## Pipeline State Tracking

The orchestrator updates `pipeline` flags in tasks.json after each phase completes. This enables resumption from any point.

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "prdCompleted": false,
    "jsonCompleted": false,
    "executionCompleted": false,
    "reviewCompleted": false,
    "prCreated": false
  },
  "correctionCycle": 0,
  "maxCorrectionCycles": 3
}
```

**When resuming (Phase 0 detects existing work):**
- If `jsonCompleted` is true but `executionCompleted` is false → resume at Phase 3
- If `executionCompleted` is true but `reviewCompleted` is false → resume at Phase 4
- If `reviewCompleted` is true but `prCreated` is false → resume at Phase 6
- If `prCreated` is true → issue is done, report completion

**Note**: The `pipeline` fields are added by convert-prd-to-json when creating tasks.json. If resuming from a tasks.json that doesn't have these fields (created by older version), treat missing fields as `false`.

## Important Rules

- **Proceed automatically between phases unless a genuine decision is needed**
- **When stopping for a decision, always present options with a recommended choice**
- **Never overwrite existing in-progress work without asking (except in auto mode)**
- **One story per iteration** — don't batch multiple stories
- **All commits must pass quality checks** — no broken code
- **Always read `issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}/progress.txt` before entering Phase 3** to understand what was done and what patterns were discovered
- **Each skill invocation is a delegation** — wait for the skill to fully complete before moving to the next phase
- **The correction loop (Phase 6) has a hard limit** — after `maxCorrectionCycles` failed attempts, stop and escalate to the user
- **Always update pipeline state** — after each phase completes, update the corresponding flag in tasks.json
- **In auto mode, the pipeline MUST NOT stop** — proceed through all phases without interruption. Only non-recoverable errors cause a stop.
